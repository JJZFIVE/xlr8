D = Done

D - ComponentIERC721 extends IERC721 instead of rewriting it
- merkle proofs/roots for whitelisting
- remove hardcoding for VRF, change to chainlink constructor
D - line 75 under mintRandomComponent() // add: require(tx.origin == msg.sender) to prevent smart contracts (and therefore bots) from minting. 
D - changed falsy require to a revert()
