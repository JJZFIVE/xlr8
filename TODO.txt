Project Management

Files we're working on right now:

1. api/server.js - Contains the endpoint (done with express) that will be called by Chainlink
- TODO: Be able to connect mongoose to our MongoDB Atlas TEST account with credentials:
username: jjzfive-harkness
password: 4WAd%40%213NGJ%40kKji
    - heads up: mongo connection doesn't like @ and ! 

- TODO: Enumerate the part numbers at the end of the get request with express (just a google search)
- TODO: Figure out querying mongo with the token indices
    - How do we test this? Develop testing

2. api/models/carmodels.js - unfinished car schema
- This has already been started
- TODO: research mongoose schema creation
- TODO: develop tests to see if what's been created is correct

3. api/.env - Ensures that if someone has the github repo, they cannot see the login variables 
- Set up .env and environment variables, use dotenv to pull into server.js file

4. create new car metadata when someone is fusing, and save that back to mongo atlas
